# VId
Unique, Random Id Generator.

An ID generator that can generate unique and Random Ids.

No need to track already generated IDs.

Even if system fails, upon restart it will give unique random IDs again.

Currently, I have kept algo as --secret--. Along with that, version Alpha's output is being put inside a Alpha* folder.

<b>Techies, non-techies can contact me on vivek.funeesh@gmail.com, if they find output-results interesting.</b>

Future 1st final version will be 50% modified version with more randomness and amount of IDs that can be generated.

<b> Before_Insight.txt conatins some of the difficulties I faced and experience I gained while understanding time & randomness.</b>

<b>EDIT 1::</b> Final Alpha Output has been attached which has astonishing results. Randomness has been increased too much.

Now little more optimization is needed along with some more randomness, load-balancing. Tracking overhead will still remain to almost-> 0.
